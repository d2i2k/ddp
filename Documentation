1.	Write a shiny application with associated supporting documentation. The documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need to get started using your application. 
See “Getting Started” tab in shiny application for Galton Family Data Analysis. 
Calculate mean parental mid-height or average of father's and mother's heights using a slider widget.
2.	Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server. 
https://d2i2k2w.shinyapps.io/GaltonFamilyData/
3.	Share the application link by pasting it into the text box below.
https://github.com/d2i2k/ddp

The application must include the following:
1.	Some form of input (widget: textbox, radio button, checkbox, ...). 
2.	Some operation on the ui input in server.R.
3.	Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations.
4.	You must also include enough documentation so that a novice user could use your application.
5.	The documentation should be at the Shiny website itself. Do not post to an external link.
